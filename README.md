About These Network Graphs

These interactive network graphs visualize legislative relationships and potential impacts on the University of Illinois. Each graph is filtered by political impact, categorized using the IGPA-provided policy categories, and enriched with LLAMA-extracted features that identify:

The political impact of each bill on the university

The intended beneficiaries of the legislation

Whether the bill seeks to increase or decrease specific policy areas

Two graph types are included:

Three-Layer Impact Graphs
Show how a bill’s extracted “increasing/decreasing aspect” connects to an intended beneficiary group, forming a three-level chain of:
Policy Aspect → Legislative Action (Increase/Decrease) → Beneficiary Category.

Standardized Category Graphs
Visualize all bills grouped into normalized policy categories, highlighting which aspects of university operations are being targeted and how frequently.

These graphs provide an at-a-glance way to explore legislative intent, impact pathways, and beneficiary patterns across the Illinois legislative landscape.
